Avoid:
{{{
out = "<html>" + head + prologue + query + tail + "</html>"
}}}
Instead, use
{{{
out = "<html>%s%s%s%s</html>" % (head, prologue, query, tail)
}}}
Even better, for readability (this has nothing to do with efficiency other than yours as a programmer), use dictionary substitution:
{{{
out = "<html>%(head)s%(prologue)s%(query)s%(tail)s</html>" % locals()
}}}

A good way to do lazy imports is:
{{{
email = None

def parse_email():
    global email
    if email is None:
        import email
}}}
