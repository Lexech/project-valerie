...and a lot more Enigma2 based settop boxes with mipsel or sh architecture. The following summary lists a few highlights of PVMC:
 * [Media modern GUI with optional animated menus] 
 * look & feel configurable due to skins
 * automatic synchronization process (download) and display of cover, backdrops and plots for movies and TV-shows from [http://www.imdb.com IMDB], [http://themoviedb.org/ themoviedb.org] and [http://thetvdb.com/ TheTVDB.com]
 * maintenance of own video collection using [WebIF Web-Interface] (=> manually edit attributes for all records like title, plot genre etc.)
 * use regular expressions in order to optimize the detection rate of the synchronization process
 * keep track of already watched movies and TV shows by using [http://trakt.tv/ Trak.TV]

== Usage of this wiki ==
=== Language selection ===
The language used for the wiki depends on the language setting of your browser. Currently the pages are localized in german and english, where englisch serves as the default language (i.e. if a page requested is not available in german automatically the english version is presented). In case the whole wiki is displayed in the wrong language you can manually switch the language by using the links right under the "star":<br>
 * de => german
 * en => english
If the language is switched manually this setting remains valid until you leave and re-visit the wiki again. By doing so there's no need to change the language of each wiki page seperately. 
<br><br>  
=== User guidance ===
The wiki uses different categories displayed in the sidebar on the left. Some of them contain some more chapters (e.g. "Valerie usage") which can be displayed by clicking the "+" => the tree expands. If you want to get rid of the sidebar jsut click the two "<<" brackets and the sidebar will vanish. By clicking the ">>" again the sidebar shows-up again.<br>
In case of huge pages we now display a table of contents auto-generated for the current page and most likely for the main headings. by clicking any of these links one can jump directly to the related topic.<br> 
Additionally we are about to add more links to other PVMC wiki pages where useful - but please keep in mind that PVMC is a high activity project and hence the wiki will always lag behind the current PVMC functionality.
