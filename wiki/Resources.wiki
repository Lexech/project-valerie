#summary Ressources and configuration files of Valerie
<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />
----
= Database files =
Valerie uses Python Pickle files located in `/hdd/valerie` (editable in the [Options main-settings]) in order to manage information for both movies and TV shows:
  * `mediafiles.db` 
  * `tables.db` 
*Please note* (since it has been asked every now and then):<br>These files don't contain "database tables", but serialized Python objects used by PVMC - and thus can neither get edited by using a text-editor nor by any other database application / SQL editor / whatever.<br>
= Configuration files =
The configuration files of Valerie are located in `/hdd/valerie` and can be edited by using the PVMC [Options main-settings]) or - more comfortable - through the [WebIF "Webinterface"].
  * `sync.xml`:
    * language used for synchronisation of titles, plots etc.
    * flag how to handle media files not found any more
  * `paths.xml`:
    * contains all search paths to be considered for synchronisation
    * list of file extansions to be considered during synchronisation (=> `avi`, `mkv`, ...)
    * categorization of folders contained in the search path => "Movie", TV-show" or both
    * dedicated setting for each folder whether to use foldername or filename for synchronisation
    * it's possible to switch on / off each search path seperately!
  * `paths.conf` (=> see `paths.xml`):
    * _old, but still supported file in case paths.xml is not present for whatever reason_
    * it's not possible to switch on / off search paths using this file!
  * `pre.conf`:
    * contains regular expressions allowing for the manipulation of the search string used for synchronisation
    * regular expressions taken from this file will be applied for both movies and TV-shows
    * *Hint:* if you messed-up this file while experimenting with your own regular expressions, just delete it and restart PVMC in order to re-create it with its default content
    * for more information on using regular expressions in order to enhance synchronisation results please see also the related chapter in the [Sync#Regular_expressions "Synchronisation" wiki page]
  * `post_movie.conf`:
    * regular expressions applicable for the search string used for movies
  * `post_tv.conf`:
    * regular expressions applicable for the search string used for TV shows
  * `blacklist.conf`:
    * movies manually removed from the database
