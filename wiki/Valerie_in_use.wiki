*This is the homescreen after you start Project Valerie. *<br>
Within Settings you can change Valerie startup behaviour, etc. In the Sync menu you can update your database. LiveTV brings you back to normal tv. Movies lists all your movie titles and TV Shows all your series.

<br><br><br><br><br>
If you use Valerie the first time, your database should be empty. Go to Sync and select settings.

After selecting the path and other settings you can sync your movies with the movieproviders. This can take a while pending on the number of your movies and the speed of your internet connection. Take a cup of coffee until the sync is completed ;-)
<br><br><br><br><br>
Now you can switch to the movies or series section.
