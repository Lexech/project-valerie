*This is the homescreen after you start Project Valerie. *<br>
On the left is the Sync menu where you can update your database. The Listen section is for furture use. On Watch you can switch between movies and series. MyTV brings you back to normal tv and on options you can change settings for Valerie.

<br><br><br><br><br>
If you use Valerie the first time, your database should be empty. Go to Sync on the left and select settings.

After selecting the path and other settings you can sync your movies with the movieproviders. This can take a while pending on the number of your movies and the speed of your internet connection. Take a cup of coffee until the sync is completed ;-)
<br><br><br><br><br>
Now you can switch to the movies and series section.
