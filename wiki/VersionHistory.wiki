#summary Version History

= Version History =
This wiki page lists the features introduced with each version of project valerie.
Not every revision will be noted here but only the for the end-user important ones like NEW, REMOVED, FIX_CRASH.
Also major version will be noted here, e.g. Version 1.1, 1.2 and so on.



*[881] v1.2*
 * NEW: Coverflow displays the plot on press KEY_INFO



Note to developers:
It would make sense that this page is being displayed when valerie detects a new version. And also that this page is being parsed to only present users the major versions instead of every nightly build.
For that it would be important that the syntax remains the same for every entry.
