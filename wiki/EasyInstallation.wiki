You want to install and use Project Valerie, but you donÂ´t know how? Here you will find all necessary information!

1. Depending on the architecture of your box download the latest version of Project Valerie from our [http://code.google.com/p/project-valerie/downloads/list download-page]:

 * for all mipsel based settop boxes (e.g. Dreambox DM800) with !OpenEmbedded 1.6 (e.g. Newnigma2 v3xx):
        `project-valerie_<rev>_mipsel_oe16.ipk`
 * for all mipsel based settop boxes with !OpenEmbedded 1.5 (e.g. Newnigma2 v2xx):
        `project-valerie_<rev>_mipsel_oe15.ipk`
 * for all other boxes (z.B. Kathrein UFS910)
        `project-valerie_<rev>_sh4.ipk`

2. Upload `project-valerie_<rev>_<version>.ipk` to your box (e.g. with WinSCP or via FTP). <br>
Alternately you can download Project Valerie via command line in a Telnet or SSH session: <br><br>
_`root@dm8000:~# wget http://project-valerie.googlecode.com/files/project-valerie_<rev>_<version>.ipk`_  <br><br>
3. After that you are ready for installing Project Valerie. You can do it via the !MediaScanner (Expansion panel), or via a SSH/Telnet Session:  <br><br>
_`root@dm8000:~# opkg install <path to file>/project-valerie_<rev>_<version>.ipk`_   <br><br>
Finally reboot Enigma2 - the Project Valerie assistant will guide you through the first steps. Project Valerie is now ready for use!
